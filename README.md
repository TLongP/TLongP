### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am  Long

I am a M.Sc graduate in mathematic at the Humboldt University at Berlin. My area is Applied Analysis.

## How do I get into the field of machine learning?

My first contact with this field is when I did a competition in [Robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net/) during a robot course at the university. At that point I did not have any knowledge in machine learning. My second crucial point of contact with machine learning was during my master thesis. This thesis is about the existence of a solution of a bilevel training scheme for denoising image, where the the original and the noise image is given and one searchs for a 'function', which optimize the $L2$-norm and the regularizing function. One example of this regularizing function is the total variation function. Here I learned about the supervised learning. This was so interesting, so I decided after submitting the master's thesis to learn more about machine learning.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for production and reading papers for example "Stitch it in Time: GAN-Based Facial Editing of Real Videos" from the authors Rotem Tzaban, Ron Mokady, Rinon Gal, Amit H. Bermano, Daniel Cohen-Or.
